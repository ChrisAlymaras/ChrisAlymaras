## Hi 👋 I'm Chris 

I'm a **Computer Engineering student** at [University of West Attica](https://ice.uniwa.gr/) with a passion for building realistic and user-friendly projects that challenge me to apply complex problem-solving skills and algorithms to design efficient solutions.

Currently focused on:
- Front-end development with **React** and **JavaScript** skills and certifications
- Building a portfolio showcasing my programming projects for recruiters (see repositories)
- Preparing for entry-level developer roles to contribute as a member of a professional team
