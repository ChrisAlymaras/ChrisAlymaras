## Hi 👋 I'm Chris 

I'm a **Computer Engineering student** at [University of West Attica](https://ice.uniwa.gr/) with a passion for building realistic and user-friendly projects that challenge me to apply complex problem-solving skills and algorithms to design efficient solutions.

Currently focused on:
- Front-end development with **React** and **JavaScript** skills and certifications
- Building a portfolio showcasing my programming projects for recruiters (see repositories)
- Preparing for entry-level developer roles to contribute as a member of a professional team

### 🦸 React Hero App
The project I am currently working on is a realistic web application built with **React**, fetching data from the **Marvel Comics API**.  
This project delivers a dynamic website experience where users can:
- 🔍 Search for specific heroes
- 🗂️ Apply filters and browse by categories
- ⭐ Add heroes to favourites
- 🛒 Interact with the interface in a way that feels similar to a **shopping website**, with smooth navigation and user‑friendly design

😄 Fun fact: *If the code doesn't bother you, don’t bother it.*
